### 🏠 2. Housing Price Prediction
- **Notebook:** `Housing-rates.ipynb`
- **Dataset:** California Housing Data
- **Goal:** Predict median house value based on location, income, rooms, etc.
- **Model Used:**
  - Linear Regression
- **Key Steps:**
  - Handled missing values in `total_bedrooms`
  - Visualized feature-target relationships
  - Encoded categorical features
  - Scaled numerical features before training
  - Evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R² score
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Add Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ridge/Lasso Regression
  - Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
  - Visualize predicted vs actual prices
