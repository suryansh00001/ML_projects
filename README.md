## üìÇ Projects Overview

### üî¨ 1. Breast Cancer Classifier
- **Notebook:** `Breast_Cancer.ipynb`
- **Dataset:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic
- **Goal:** Classify tumors as Benign or Malignant
- **Models Used:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost (I don't know this model very perfectly though)
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
- **Highlights:**
  - Feature correlation analysis
  - Density plots by diagnosis
  - Accuracy comparison across models using bar plots

### üè† 2. Housing Price Prediction
- **Notebook:** `Housing-rates.ipynb`
- **Dataset:** California Housing Data
- **Goal:** Predict median house value based on location, income, rooms, etc.
- **Model Used:**
  - Linear Regression
- **Key Steps:**
  - Handled missing values in `total_bedrooms`
  - Visualized feature-target relationships
  - Encoded categorical features
  - Scaled numerical features before training
  - Evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ score
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Add Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ridge/Lasso Regression
  - Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
  - Visualize predicted vs actual prices
