# ML Projects ðŸš€

A collection of machine learning projects implemented in Python using scikit-learn, XGBoost, and more.  
Each project is based on real-world datasets and includes data cleaning, EDA, model building, and evaluation.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Overview

### 1. Breast Cancer Classifier
- **Notebook:** `Breast_Cancer_Classifier.ipynb`
- **Dataset:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic
- **Goal:** Classify tumors as Benign or Malignant
- **Models Used:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost (with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV)
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix and ROC Curves
  - AUC Comparison across models
- **Highlights:**
  - Feature correlation analysis
  - Density plots by diagnosis
  - Model comparison and tuning
  - Final model: Tuned XGBoost (97% CV, ~94% test accuracy)

### 2. Housing Price Prediction
- **Notebook:** `Housing-rates.ipynb`
- **Dataset:** California housing data
- **Goal:** Predict median house value based on location, income, rooms, etc.
- **Model Used:**
  - Linear Regression
- **Key Steps:**
  - Cleaned missing values from `total_bedrooms`
  - Visualized relationships between features
  - Encoded categorical columns
  - Scaled features before regression
  - Evaluated with RMSE, MAE, RÂ² Score
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Add Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Ridge/Lasso Regression
  - Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
  - Visualize model predictions vs actual values
